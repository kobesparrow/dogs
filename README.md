#Dog Party
---
A beginning coder's initial attempt at building a simple website from a given comprehensive layout.

###Description
Dog Party is my first project as a front end developer student at Turing School in Denver, Colorado. The individual project involved was assigned on our first day before we had any HTML or CSS training, and due six days later. The site may not fill a great public need, but the time spent building it has served me in grasping basic HTML and CSS formants which will help dearly in the coming months.

###Finished Product

####Biggest Wins
Day three of the project was a "near tears" experience as I spent the day mired in self-doubt without direction. While I stress ate 25 chicken wings I sketched psuedo code on a greasy napkin, came home and crushed it, rewriting the entire site before bedtime.

####Biggest Stuggles
Vocabulary is a huge hurdle for me. I know what I want to do but am unfamiliar with the tags or declarations available to make it work. Likely this lexicon will come with practice and time.
